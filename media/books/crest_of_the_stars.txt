This crest depicts a Gaftonosh. The grotesque eight-headed dragon was long lost to the ages — forgotten, alive only in myth.
Resurrected on an Imperial crest, the Gaftonosh became infamous. The reason being that the empire which chose the dragon for its symbol became the strongest race in human history — creating an intergalactic civilization without parallel.
They were called the Abh, and they proudly referred to themselves as "kin of the stars."
At any rate, we'll restrict the story here to the Gaftonosh, because there are countless other books about the Abh.
— Excerpt from Monsters That Lived on Earth by Roberto Lopez.
Prologue

Wow. Jinto Linn marveled at the night sky. It's incredible.
Like swarming bees, dozens of Abh battleships soared through the heavens, trailing long tails of light. Their incredible speed made them look shapeless, even when they flew disarmingly close to Planet Martine's surface. Floating menacingly amid the ships was a glowing orb that looked like the nucleus of an enormous atom.
Jinto watched the ominous sphere. He found its faint phosphorescence beautiful. The glowing ball was the remains of a manmade satellite that had mysteriously exploded thirty days earlier. Its slow orbit made the people of Martine anxious. Then one day, like a beehive awakening in the spring, Abh battleships began to materialize from the orb. This terrified the Martinese.
Although it was past his bedtime, Jinto now watched the luminous display from the rooftop garden of his residential complex. He was not supposed to be out so late alone; he was only eight years old. For old-timers intent on sticking to Earth's standard calendar, that actually worked out to ten years old. Either way, he was just a boy.
 
* * *
 
Long before Jinto was born, all of humanity dwelled in a star system they called the "Solar System," in honor of their sun. Intent on exploring the vastness of space, they launched innumerable spacecraft. On its maiden voyage, one research vessel named the Oort Cloud discovered a mysterious particle approximately three-tenths of a lightyear from the sun. It was only about a thousand times the mass of a proton, but somehow it radiated nearly five hundred megawatts of energy. No one on the Oort Cloud could determine the source of this energy.
The astronauts had hypotheses. One of them said there was a "white hole," and another said it was "null space" or "hyperspace." Regardless of the moniker, they all reasoned that mysterious particles of this nature were probably holes in the walls that separate one universe from another.
Scientists didn't get a chance to do much research on the nature and origin of these particles; they had barely named them Yuanons, when they were instructed to shift their research to focus on exploiting the particles' energy. (People were always on the lookout for potential sources of energy.)
At that time, mankind had developed nuclear fusion, which was mostly clean and efficient when used on Earth, but proved cumbersome in outer space. In order to reach a neighboring star, a nuclear-powered spacecraft had to be loaded with hundreds of times its own weight in fuel — that was an established fact of physics. This was not practical at all! Bussard-style Ramscoop propulsion was equally inefficient because of its relation to the density of interstellar matter. In short, every known fuel source simply weighed too much.
But if, and this was a big if, people could harness the ower of the Yuanons, then they could throw all their previous methods of spacecraft propulsion right out the window. Fuel would be obsolete.
With many motivated minds concentrated on this task, it wasn't long before engineers drew up the specs for a Yuanon-powered spaceship. The ship was similar in shape to a giant tube, lined with superconductive materials that could absorb excess energy emitted by the Yuanons. Complicated magnets would then regulate the flow of this energy into the ship's propulsion systems, so that it could change directions. In theory, it was brilliant. In practical application, it was imperfect at best.
However, prescient that the population was growing at a rate the planet could not sustain, people had been exploring nearby star systems with unmanned probes for the purpose of colonization. Unfortunately, their research indicated that planets with atmospheric oxygen were extremely rare. Planets with oxygen, solar energy from a nearby star, and a gravitational pull similar to Earth's were even more rare. Planets like Earth were exceptions among exceptions; there really weren't many places for carbon-based life forms to live comfortably.
Although the Yuanon propulsion technology was not perfect, population growth necessitated interplanetary transit, and the demand for Yuanon-powered ships grew. So, with great effort, the first Yuanon propulsion spaceship was built, and aptly named the Pioneer. Capable of transporting equipment and people efficiently, the ship enabled humanity to commence with interstellar colonization.
Rather than use the ship to continue searching for needles in the endless haystack of space, people decided to make their own colonies; they devoted themselves to making teraforming technology — altering a planet's hostile conditions to make it suitable for human habitation.
Everyone was anxious to try this technology, so they went to the nearest planets that had even one characteristic in common with Earth. Mars and Venus were both relatively close and deemed adequate guinea pigs. Scientists increased the thin atmospheres to make breathing possible. They artificially simulated eons of erosion to create soil suitable for growing crops. Nascent technology enabled them to mass-produce water from scratch. They constructed entire artificial ecosystems.
These experiments on Mars and Venus were highly successful. As a bonus for the conscience of the human race, if they continued to make uninhabitable planets habitable, they'd never have to worry about pushing out any native species.
Once the new ecosystems were set up, ferries brought people to the artificial environments. As they expanded their living sphere, people found more and more Yuanons, which enabled them to build more and more ships. Whereas before, Yuanon ships were used exclusively for transporting materials, they now became integral to all aspects of the colonization process. This way, people could extend their reach far beyond the Solar System.
Engineers built a ship called the Leif Erikson that was only equipped for exploration and immigration — particularly the investigation and selection of potential residences. The government held a lottery to choose the Leif Erikson's crew. The ship was quickly stocked and launched with little ceremony.
Despite this bland sendoff, the passengers and crew of the Leif Erikson held high hopes. They weren't going to give up until they found a suitable planet. This determination was instrumental to their success.
Fully expecting to find an exotic ecosystem somewhere, the Leif Erikson drifted aimlessly through space for multiple generations, eventually finding a blue planet orbiting a G-type star. They named the star Hyde, after Martine Hyde, the ship's first captain, who never lived to see his dream fulfilled. In honor of his indomitable spirit, they called the blue planet Martine.
There was no intelligent life on Planet Martine, but peculiar flora and fauna abounded. The colonists, ever mindful of the strange ecosystem, increased their population slowly.
Having fulfilled its primary purpose, the interstellar
immigration ship Leif Erikson remained in orbit around Planet Martine, almost like a monument satellite.
On the fifty-seventh day of the one hundred and second year after colonization, the Leif Erikson suddenly exploded without warning. All that remained of the vessel was a spherical, gaseous cloud, which continued to orbit the planet.
This nebulous cloud was actually comprised of the Leif Erikson's Yuanon, which had violently changed state and shape. Because it phosphoresced such brilliant colors, people eventually regarded it fondly, as if it were Martine's moon.
Unexpectedly, a spaceship materialized from within the gaseous lump and immediately circled Planet Martine. The ship refused all requests for communication, increasing the anxiety of Martine's inhabitants. After its third circuit around Martine, the ship vanished as quickly as it came, disappearing into the faintly glowing sphere of the Yuanon cloud.
Twenty-four days later, on the eighty-first day of the year, an entire flying armada emerged from the spherical space.
Identifying themselves as the Abh, the people inside the ships wanted to communicate this time. Conversation was possible because the recon ship that came three weeks earlier determined that the Martine language was based on English. The Abh had high-tech machines that instantly translated their own guttural language into perfectly articulated English.
When the Abh appeared on the Martinese video-conferencing screens, they were all young and beautiful, incredibly similar in appearance to humans, except for their electric-blue hair. "Despite some physical differences, we are also children of Earth," the Abh explained. "We've simply adjusted our genes slightly."
The Abh said they ruled approximately fifteen hundred inhabited star systems and more than twenty thousand partially inhabited star systems. Their massive territory reached such vast corners of the universe that it was called Humankind Empire of Abh (Frybar Gloer Gor Bari), or simply "Abh Empire" (Frybar) for short.
Ever optimistic, the Martine government requested friendly negotiations. Commander-in-Chief Abriel, the leader of the Abh invasion fleet, flatly refused.
"Regrettably," Abriel said with no hint of actual regret, "we cannot do that. Our mission is not to make friends for the Empire, but to add new worlds to Her Majesty the Empress' territory."
Because the Abh sent a heavily armed battle fleet rather than an unarmed ship, the people of Martine were not terribly surprised to hear the Abh's objective. They were surprised, however, by the candor with which Abriel announced these intentions.
The people of Martine wanted to appeal to a diplomat — surely there had to be someone with more authority who would be sympathetic to their plight.
"I am not just a soldier," Abriel explained. "I am also a diplomat."
But of what rank? With what authority? The people of Martine wanted to know.
"Actually, I am the crown prince. My will is the will of the Empire." He paused. "I understand your anxiety, but I will not enter negotiations concerning your independence. I will, however, clarify your position as subjects of the Empire."
After a brief deliberation, the government concluded that, since the invasion would affect the entire population of the planet, the Abh's address should be broadcast. So, the government relayed the image of the commander-in-chief speaking from the flagship to the video screens for the general public, giving the citizens their first look at the invader.
Most people thought he looked like an elf. Pointed ears poked out of Abriel's waist-long hair, which was the color of a blue raspberry frozen yogurt. His pallid face suggested an approximate age of twenty-five. His features were so delicate, his expression so languid, he could have easily been mistaken for a woman who found the subjugation of star systems to be quite tedious.
"Now. I will relate the gist of the relationship between the Empire and land worlds," the crown prince of the Abh Empire began calmly. "Due to this star system's special characteristics, Her Majesty the Empress will be your ruler, at least for the time being. Since she is enormously busy, she will dispatch a noble representative or a Fapyut... that means Sovereign.
"In general, we do not enjoy the unsophisticated triviality of governing land worlds; as long as your surface dwellers can maintain order, our representative will not be obtrusive to your daily operations.
"You will also need to select an official to serve as a negotiator with the sovereign and the central Empire. You may call your official whatever you like: President, Chief, Chairman, Kaiser, even Emperor if it comforts you to maintain the illusion that you are an independent nation. Our documents will refer to this official as the Territorial Representative.
"How you choose this official is entirely up to you. Election, heredity, or lottery — it is of no importance to us. However, we do exercise final approval of any appointed official. This is mostly a formality, but we won't allow one who advocates secession from the Empire.
"The sovereign does not have the right to tax you. But the Empire retains the right to monopolize commerce with other star systems. All profits from your interstellar trade will go to the funding of Imperial activities. Depending on the economic potential, we may opt to invest in your planet or other planets in your star system. And, in order to protect our investment, it may be necessary for us to implement a garrison that will operate independently from your governmental mechanism.
"The Empire will impose two conditions on you. One, we prohibit the construction of spaceships capable of interstellar travel. Although Imperial technology enables us to fly faster than the speed of light, do not even consider this for your people.
"Also, you are not to attempt traveling to other star systems through normal space. We simply will not allow it; we must preserve our monopoly on interstellar business. With the sovereign's approval, however, you may own spaceships for travel within your star system. But under no circumstances may these ships be armed.
"Our second demand is the construction of a recruitment office for the Imperial Star Force. We will dispatch officers whose authority will be limited to issues of vour defense. Based on your population, this shouldn't equate morere than a hundred persons. As long as your autonomous government functions properly, we will not deploy more officers without your consent. Neither will we conscript soldiers; participation in our Star Force is entirely voluntary. Keep in mind, though, we will not tolerate activities that hinder anyone's decision to volunteer.
"Your people will be known as territorial citizens, but volunteer members of the Star Force become vassals of the sovereign. This means that if you choose to work for the Empire, you will become an Imperial citizen and fall under the umbrella of the Empire's protection.
"Your everyday lives may change dramatically, but not from Imperial imposition; rather, the imports our interstellar trade brings to your planet will cause these changes. Once you become accustomed to the new goods, most of you territorial citizens will be able to function normally, only subconsciously aware that you are subjects of the Empire.
"This concludes my statement.
"Doubtless, you have countless questions for my subordinates. Please decide whether you will accept these conditions peacefully, or if you wish us to force them on you. Although your planet contains many valuable resources, I will not hesitate to decimate as much of it as it takes to make you submit.
"Luckily for us, your capital city is very contained; we can likely destroy it without damaging the valuable surrounding environment.
"Now, feel free to pester my underlings with your questions, but know that there are limits to their patience. You have exactly three planetary rotations from now to respond. Transmission complete."
The people of Martine did not care for Abh manners. Although Abriel's tone was courteous, he made no attempts to disguise his extreme indifference to their existence. Martine's governmental officials found Abriel's arrogance particularly infuriating. Was it really necessary for him to label their jobs — jobs they'd worked extremely hard to attain — as "unsophisticated trivialities"?
Although Abriel stated that Imperial subjects were granted a high level of autonomy, the Martinese were not certain whether to believe him. Perhaps, in truth, the Empire was cruel and despotic.
Frustrated, the bureaucrats pelted the Abh officers with innumerable questions. The responses they received were ambiguous; it was impossible to determine the Abh's level of trustworthiness. Short on time, the governmental representatives called for backup: Martine's best lawyers. The attorneys grilled the invaders, but were unable to unearth any misstatements or contradictions.
As Martine's citizens came to their planet from elsewhere in space, they'd predicted that other colonizers would also appear someday. Fearing potential hostility, they'd even built an anti-invasion defense system.
Unfortunately, this defense system was not a top priority in the budget. There were fewer than ten anti-invasion lasers, and only about twenty anti-spacecraft missiles. There was no Martinese Space Army — there wasn't even an office. Instead, there was a small room behind the janitorial closet where the laser and missile maintenance records collected dust. During a crisis, control of the weapons fell to one semi-retired general, who often slept in the underground control room because it made him feel important.
The only other institution even remotely resembling a military force on Martine was its police force, which was equipped to handle a large-scale riot of unarmed civilians, but not a fleet of heavily armed spacecraft.
Regardless, a faction of Congress called for resistance, reasoning that the large space fleet was probably just a bluff. And, although outmatched in space, if they could somehow bring the battle down to the surface, they could certainly beat the Abh. The pillar of their argument was honor; how could they surrender without even fighting?
Those opposed to war were equally obdurate, and arguments ensued. Heads butted, philosophies clashed, and pigheaded men slandered each other. This only set the opposing sides deeper into the trenches of their respective mindsets. Even though a Martine day was two hours longer than an Earth day, they only had three of them to make up their minds. That wasn't very much time at all.
Frustrated, Congress did manage to agree that they were never going to come to an agreement. Ultimately, they left the decision to the president.
Rock Linn, Jinto's father, was the president.
President Linn made an executive decision and ran it by his trusted advisors, who issued him their wholehearted support. Of course, his decision could not possibly please everyone.
As the deadline drew near, President Linn stood before the presidential mansion's communication equipment, prepared to give his answer.
 
* * *
 
Elsewhere, Jinto stared at the lightshow in the sky, completely engrossed. He'd never seen anything so beautiful or frightening in his life. "I've been looking for you."
Jinto turned around to see Teal Clint, his father's private secretary. A tall, thin man, Teal Clint had worked for President Linn since the latter had been a mere congressman — before Jinto was even born.
Before Jinto could utter his first words, his mother, a mining supervisor, died in a freak accident. Rock Linn, ill-prepared to deal with a son as a single father, asked Teal and his wife, Lena, to raise Jinto. The Clints had no children of their own, and gladly accepted.
Until he went to school and overheard classroom gossip, Jinto actually believed he was Teal's son. He continued to love the chief secretary like a father, even after the discovery that Rock Linn was his biological parent. As for Lena Clint, he loved her more than anyone else in the world.
There, on the rooftop garden, a shadow hung over Teal's already swarthy face.
"I'm sorry," Jinto apologized, thinking he might be scolded for staying outside so late, especially on such a dangerous night. "I'll go back to my room right away." "It's okay. Come with me," Teal commanded. "Where are we going?" Jinto asked, somewhat frightened by Teal's grave tone. "The presidental mansion." "The mansion? Why are we going there?" "Just come with me," Teal demanded, turning to go. Grandon City was Planet Martine's only metropolis. Within its walls, there were three residential complexes, sensibly named Omni I, Omni II, and Omni III. The Clints lived in Omni III, but the president's mansion was all the way over in Omni I. For Jinto, a trip to the presidental mansion invariably meant seeing his father. What could Father possibly want with me at a time like this? And doesn't Teal Clint, the president's chief secretary, have something more important to do than fetch an eight-year-old?
"Hey, wait," Jinto called, unable to keep up with Teal's long strides. Teal was usually considerate of the differences in height, and normally accommodated Jinto by walking slower. Why is there such a rush tonight?
"Time is short. Hurry," Teal said without slowing his pace.
Jinto managed to catch up to Teal in front of the elevator. "Are you mad at me? Whatever I did..."
Teal did not respond, but impatiently mashed the elevator call button a few times. Jinto started to get really nervous. When the elevator door opened and no one else was inside, Jinto wasn't a hundred percent sure he wanted to go. He didn't have time to think it over much, as Teal quickly ushered him into the elevator.
"Nexus Floor," Teal instructed the elevator's voice-activated control system.
The door closed and they began the descent in silence.
"You think we can win?" Jinto asked when he couldn't take the silence anymore.
"It's not about winning or losing; it's not a war." Teal sounded disgusted.
"We surrendered?"
Teal glared. "Yes. Your father waved the white flag. He sold us out."
"What do you mean?"
"That bastard made a deal. A filthy deal," Teal spat out viciously.
"Deal?"
"What are you, a parrot?"
"S-sorry," Jinto apologized, hanging his head.
Teal sighed. "I didn't want a war either. There's no way we could win. But to make a deal like that..." he paused. "Damn it! I really misjudged that asshole!"
Secretly proud to have two fathers, it pained Jinto to see the one who raised him badmouthing his sire.
When Jinto's eyes started to water, and Teal could see sadness twist the boy's face, the older man instantly felt guilty. "Sorry. It's not your fault."
"What happened, anyway?"
"Oh, right," Teal said, tousling Jinto's short, black hair. "Like I said, Rock made a deal. He's going to announce the details in about ten minutes. After that, everyone on this planet is going to hate him. They will hate him enough to hate you, just because you're his son. That's why we're going to the presidential mansion — it's more secure."
"Are they going to kill me?" Jinto shuddered.
"Don't know. They might try. At the very least, they will hate you — they will curse your name and throw things at you. I wouldn't be surprised if someone threw a smoke bomb into your room."
"What about Lena?" Jinto asked automatically. "A lot of people know I live with you."
"I already contacted her. Besides, Lena's an adult. She can take care of herself."
"So she already left?" Jinto asked, surprised she would go without him.
"Yes," Teal said, "but she was extremely worried about you. She made me promise to find you."
"Oh. I see." Jinto felt relieved that she had thought of him. Now it was his turn to be worried for her —since there was no guarantee that Teal would find him, who's to say Lena wouldn't conduct her own search?
The elevator arrived at the Nexus Floor and the door opened. Silently, they exited. Countless elevator tubes lined the Nexus Floor in a design somewhat reminiscent of an ancient temple's columns. In addition to the vertical elevators, the floor was inundated with taxi boxes, which were essentially laterally moving elevators. The taxi boxes were programmed to arrive right in front of the elevator
Teal motioned Jinto into a waiting taxi box. Jinto sat till but his heart continued to race.
"The president's mansion. No stops " Teal ordered the taxi box. Once again, he fell silent.
Extremely intimidated but infinitely curious, Jinto wondered what kind of "deal" his father had made. This isn't really the right time to ask. But if not now, when? "What is the deal Teal?"
"It's classified. We can't let the general public know about it until the announcement."
"Even me?"
Teal scoffed. "Are you pulling rank already? You little stinker."
Jinto smiled.
"Put on the holo. The announcement will come on soon."
Always quick to follow orders, Jinto pushed the taxi box's holovision switch. Immediately, a hologram appeared where the taxi box's manual controls were. The hologram was of a man — a miniature, translucent newscaster — broadcasting live updates.
"Now, a breaking report," the tiny, semitransparent man said. "At this time, we're receiving reports that the Abh ships aren't leaving. Sources close to President Linn speculate the president plans to surrender to the Empire. I, for one, sincerely hope this is just speculation. Oh. I'm receiving another report — the president is going to make an announcement at exactly twenty-five hundred hours. That's in one minute and thirty seconds."
The newscaster did his best to fill the longest ninety seconds of Jinto's life. But Jinto was too anxious for the announcement and too scared of its contents to pay attention to the holovision. Instead, he watched Teal, who stared straight ahead, as still as a statue.
The taxi box exited the complex, rocketing through the liaison tube that served as a vehicular bridge over the jungle.
Finally, it was time.
The image of the newsman cut to a traditional press conference room with an unmanned podium. A solemn spokesperson stepped up to the mike.
"As you may have already heard, I have an announcement."
Jinto held his breath.
"Today, at 23:52, President Rock Linn handed over control of the Hyde star system to His Highness Dusanyu, Crown Prince, and Imperial Fleet Commander-in-Chief King Abriel Nei Lamsar Balkei. From this day forth, Planet Martine is part of the Abh Empire of Humankind."
Although the press weren't visible in the hologram, their resignation was certainly audible. They weren't surprised or angry, just disappointed. "Just as I expected," said one of the faceless reporters.
That isn't so bad, Jinto thought, scanning Teal's face for any hint of a reaction.
Seeing Jinto's confusion, Teal spoke up. "There's more," he explained stoically.
"President Linn," continued the spokesman, "proposed a compromise."
"Can he do that?" asked someone from the media.
"Try to bear with me for a minute; I'll take questions at the end. In exchange for the override codes to our anti-spacecraft weapons, he requested that the new sovereign be a citizen of the Hyde star system."
"And did the Abh accept?"
"Please be seated and save your questions for the end, okay? Thank you. Apparently, the Abh were more apprehensive of our weaponry than we thought; they accepted the president's terms."
"Who will our Fapyut be?"
The spokesman sighed. "As Commander-in-Chief Abriel explained, the sovereign is more like the owner of a space trading company than a governmental figure. As you all know, the owners of most businesses are chosen by heredity, not democracy."
"Bull!" The disembodied voices were getting discernibly more agitated. "You better tell us it's not who we think it is!"
"This can't be happening," Jinto said to himself.
Teal kept his mouth shut.
Exasperated, the spokesperson sighed. "I see there's no fooling you; the new sovereign to the star system will be Rock Linn."
The ethereal voices were undeniably pissed.
"Now you get it?" Teal asked. "He gave away our independence and the only weapon we had, just to become a nobleman. I never thought they'd take that deal. They must have been more afraid of our weapons than we thought. Who knows? Maybe we could have won!"
"But, but ..." Jinto trailed off, trying to defend his father's honor. "Maybe my father requested an election."
"There's no way of knowing." Teal ground his teeth. "We only heard the terms of the agreement after it was done... after the Abh deactivated our defense system... after the Linn family became Imperial nobles. The bastard never even consulted me. Me, Chief Secretary! I thought I was his friend, his confidant. Turns out he just needed me to take care of his kid."
So that's it! Jinto thought. Teal's taking it personally.
After many futile attempts, the hologram spokesperson finally gained order, yelling, "For goodness' sake, behave yourselves!" Satisfied with the results, he continued. "If you think it through, you'll see this is really the best possible solution. Sovereign Linn will be more sympathetic to our needs than an imported ruler. He is committed to following our established democratic rules, as long as we don't violate any of the Empire's laws. Here's a question for you. Could we expect that from a native Imperial noble? I don't think so. We will retain the largest degree of autonomy of any star system in the Empire."
"Poppycock!"
"Why should we trust Linn?"
"Yeah, why isn't he here, making this announcement himself?"
"Where is he? Where's President — I mean Sovereign — Linn?"
Noticeably flustered, the spokesperson was reluctant to speak. "In order to finalize the details of the agreement, Rock Linn has gone to the Imperial capital, Lakfakalle. He boarded an Abh landing craft on French Plain. Right now, he's probably already aboard the fleet's flagship."
"The jackass ran away!" someone yelled.
"Is he coming back?" another asked.
"Oh, he'll come back — with a boatload of Imperial bodyguards!"
"The Empire won't make him a nobleman. They're lying to him, and it serves him right!"
"Everyone, please!" The spokesperson frantically tried to calm them down. "Please understand, the motivation behind the president's decision is our collective well-being, not his own, so — " Jinto flipped the holovision off.
"There it is," Teal said. "After Rock, you'll be the next sovereign. You're our prince now, Jinto. Whoops. Please forgive me any rudeness, Your Highness. Excuse me. Excuse me."
Teal bowed excessively to augment his bitter jibe.
"That's not fair, Teal." Jinto was on the verge of tears.
"I know." Teal still couldn't look at the boy. "I know I shouldn't take it out on you, but damn it! I don't even know what to think right now."
The taxi box entered the Nexus Floor of Omni I. It wouldn't be long until they reached the elevator to the presidential mansion.
"Tell me one thing, Teal."
"What's that?"
"When you told Lena to run away..." Jinto didn't want to finish the question, but he was just too curious. "Did you tell her about the deal, too?"
Teal hesitated just long enough to make the truth of his answer suspect. "No. It was classified."
"I see." Jinto could practically hear the sound of his beloved, familiar world falling to pieces.
1 Delktou Spaceport (Bidaut Delktour)

It's different from how I remember it.
Noise assaulted Jinto as he emerged from the surface-to-spaceport Dobroria. He paused before the ascent-tube.
Oh well. At least the gravity is the same as on Delktou, so I won't puke.
Jinto tried to recall the details of his only previous trip to the spaceport. That was seven years before, when he came to Planet Delktou from Planet Martine, or Martinu, as the Abh called it.
I must have passed through here on my way to the Rebisath's stateroom, he thought. The memory of the passenger ship was hazy, at best.
With all sorts of ascent-tubes sprouting out of the huge, circular floor, the spaceport reminded Jinto of the Nexus Floor of the complex where he grew up. There was one glaring difference, however; the spaceport boasted a huge banquet hall.
Lined with tables and chairs, the hall was full of jovial people speaking languages from all corners of the universe. Both human waiters and robotic vending machines hustled from table to table, serving food and drinks.
The people of Delktou sure know how to kill time, Jinto thought. I wonder if it'll be like this in Frybar spaceports.
Periodically, the informational announcements over-powered the background music. "Will passengers booked on the ship LengarfGlorn to Estote Park at 17:30 please report to Dobroria Seventeen to finalize boarding procedures."
The informational broadcasts always came over the loudspeaker twice; first in Delktou's native tongue, then in the Abh language.
A few disgruntled passengers exited the banquet hall, pushing past Jinto and his rolling suitcase. As they exited, the noise of the spaceport swallowed them up.
"To all passengers disembarking from the ship Sellef Nizeil, thank you for your patience, and welcome to Dreujhe Vorlak! An expedited surface-bound descent-tube will depart in three minutes."
A group of passengers, who appeared to have recently gotten off the Sellef Nizeil, made no moves toward the descent tubes. They were too busy consuming massive quantities of liquor (Skiade) in what looked like a spirited drinking contest.
How many drunk people miss their ships every day? Jinto wondered.
It was a valid quality; most passengers leaving the star system were immigrants, for whom this would be a once-in-a-lifetime space voyage. So of course they wanted to make the most of it.
No one invited Jinto for a drink. He didn't expect them to — although Delktou's people were generally friendly, no one had spoken to Jinto since he first got into the ascent-tube. When he approached people, they looked the other way. He felt extremely isolated.
Wearing the standard-issue garments for an Imperial noble (addressed as Rue Sif), Jinto realized how ridiculous he must have looked. People would have to be nuts to talk to someone like me.
There was nothing wrong with Jinto's bodysuit (Sorf); it was very modern. The problem was the long robe (called a Daush), he wore on top of it. A shoulder-to-foot garment, the robe billowed, except where Jinto's sash (Kutaroev) cinched it around his waist. On top of that, the thing was sleeveless, with stiff shoulder pads that looked like upside-down triangles. The cuffs and collar had a thick, scarlet border.
The computer crystal (a Datykirl) built into Jinto's wristband computer (Kreuno) was green, to prove his family's status as rising noblity. Though he didn't know it, the elegant crown (known as an Alpha) on his head also corresponded to Jinto's social status, since he was pretty much guaranteed the right to wear the Imperial Crest Medal (Gal Skas).
This was the first day that Jinto had dressed as a noble. The result was only slightly less foolish-looking than he'd anticipated. His shoulders were a bit wider than those of a typical Abh, but everything was probably within the acceptable range.
However, Jinto was clearly not an Abh; his light brown hair gave him away. On top of that, it was common for Imperial nobles to be left alone in an Imperial spaceport.
"Hey! Linn Jinto!"
At first, Jinto thought he was hearing things. But on Delktou, unlike Martine, they use the family name first, so that was definitely his name. Maybe he'd misheard, or maybe somebody else had the same name.
Jinto smiled when he spotted a beefy boy occupying a four-person table.
"Ku Dorin!" Jinto called, half running to the table. "What are you doing here?"
"I came to see you off, knucklehead!"
"Gee, thanks," Jinto laughed.
"I'm sorry. Is Your Nobleness offended by the presence of a poor commoner kid?"
Jinto smiled. "Don't you know what 'thanks' means?"
"Oh. Is that what you said? Your imitation immigrant accent is so thick! Sit down already. I'm tired of waiting."
"I wish you'd called. We could have met properly." Jinto sat and looked around expectantly.
Dorin squirmed. "The others aren't coming. I'm the only one who's seeing you off."
"I see," Jinto said, trying unsuccessfully to hide his disappointment.
"To tell you the truth, I was nervous about it, too. I thought you might ignore me."
"What? Why?" Jinto frowned. "Come on. We're bound by the sport of minchiu! I could never ignore you."
A cross between soccer and roller derby, minchiu was the most popular sport in Delktou society. Teams comprised ten members. Delktou had a professional minchiu league, and every region, school, corporation, and hospital seemed to have a team.
At his school, Jinto had discovered an aptitude for the game. He joined a regional team. There, he'd made his first friends, starting with Ku Dorin.
However, Jinto kept one secret from the minchiu team; he pretended to be the child of ordinary immigrants. He'd only confessed his status as Rue Sif three days earlier, when he told his teammates that he had to leave Delktou. The air couldn't have been chillier if he'd confessed to murder. It was so unbearable, Jinto literally ran away from the scene.
"Who knew how you'd act? Who really knew anything about you?" As soon as he said it, Dorin's face turned dark.
"Fair enough," Jinto said. "Maybe it's my fault for keeping it a secret. But, tell me this — if I'd said I was a noble, you think they would have accepted me?" Dorin shook his head. "No, probably not." "Definitely not."
"Nobody knew how to behave around a noble. I mean, we've never even seen a Lef," Dorin said, wrinkling his nose at the Abh word for gentry.
"I get it. I don't even know how to behave, myself." "Deep," Dorin assessed. "You know, those Sif clothes really suit you."
"This clown suit?" Jinto pinched the Daush in his fingers. "Come on. I know how ridiculously un-Abh I look."
"No, no. You don't stand out at all." Jinto grinned. "Stop that." "Are you on your way home from here?" "What?" Jinto realized he'd forgotten to tell anyone where he was going. "Oh! No. I'm going to Lakfakalle." "The Imperial capital? The Arosh?" "Yeah, studying abroad again. Kenru Sazoir this time."
"What's that?" Dorin asked. It certainly sounded impressive.
"A school that specializes in training military administrators," Jinto explained. "It's an officer school. The Abh call it Lodairl Sazoir. I took the exam two months ago at Labule's Banzorl Ludorlt."
Dorin's eyes popped open. "So you're joining the Star Force?"
"Yeah."
"But you have a Ribeun. Why bother?" "I've got a territory, but there's more to inheriting a Sune than being born into a noble family. To earn my title,
I'm actually required to serve as an officer —who are called Lodair — for at least ten years. The only reason my father didn't have to do it was because he was already middle-aged at the time of his appointment." "Sounds hard, being a Sif."
"Yeah. It's depressing; three years as a Kenyu in the Star Force, ten years as an officer — that's thirteen years of military life. On the other hand, I guess it makes sense that the Frybar requires military service proportional to your social station."
"Will you ever go home?"
"Eventually, I'll have to. It's my Ribeun." Jinto felt odd, calling his old home his territory.
"I meant now. You've already been gone a long time," Dorin said, trying to imagine what it would be like to leave Delktou for so long.
"Yeah, well..." Although he received monthly news updates from his father, Jinto hadn't set foot on Martine in seven years — long enough to doubt his ability to speak Martinese properly. The last news Jinto heard from his father was that Teal Clint was the leader of a volatile group of anti-Empire insurgents.
"It doesn't seem like my home, anyway. All the people there hate me."
"Huh." Dorin didn't understand Jinto's indifference to his home planet. The people of Delktou loved their planet and feared leaving more than anything else. "But you still want to be the sovereign?"
"No, I don't," Jinto spoke at the table. "But even if I renounced my inheritance and went back to being a regular citizen of Martine, I'd never be forgiven. The best I could ever do is become a citizen of Delktou."
"So why don't you do that?" Dorin demanded indignantly.
"I'm not sure I can redeem myself in the eyes of the people, but my father seems to think I can."
"And you believe him?"
"He's very persuasive. I'm convinced he's working for the sake of the Hyde star system, and I intend to do that too, if I can."
Rock Linn had given his son an earful on the subject. Martine had immense resources, he explained, just like Earth. The planet already had a glut of incredible fauna, which had only increased through Martinese gene-splicing experiments.
If the Martinese could trade their bioresources with other star systems, then they would become enormously wealthy. And if they entrusted this trade to the Rue Sif, it would be much easier for the profits to spill over into the hands of the general public. Thus, everyone won.
In order to ensure the proper allocation of the proceeds, a citizen of the Hyde star system had to be its ruler and govern the trade.
"Ah, I can understand that," Dorin said after Jinto finished his explanation.
"That's why I'm still a noble. But there's one problem with the whole scheme."
"What's that?"
"Well, I'm not a citizen of the Hyde star system anymore; it's impossible to be a citizen of Hyde star system and an Abh noble simultaneously. We have no Hyde citizenship rights. My children will be engineered, both genetically and culturally; beautiful, blue-haired Abh — in body and spirit. So who's to say how many generations of the Linn family will continue to work for the good of the Hyde people?"
Dorin looked impressed. "You're too serious, man. Forget about all the people who hate you and start thinking about yourself. Decide whether or not you actually want to fill your father's shoes. Personally, I wouldn't want to forfeit such a huge business, but maybe that's just me."
Fill my father's shoes, huh? Jinto pondered, amused. If he didn't become the next count (Dreu), the Linn family legacy would come to an end. And so what? Who would really care?
"You're right," Jinto acquiesced.
"Of course I'm right," Dorin stated. He suddenly pointed at the floor. "You know, this is the first time I've ever been up in the spaceport. From up here, Delktou looks really awesome."
"Yes," Jinto agreed. "It does."
Underneath the table was a video screen displaying an aerial view of the planet. From their position, the orbital tower (called an Arnej) connecting the surface to the spaceport looked small and weak, as if made of dental floss. Shrouded in clouds, the planet disappeared in the light from the star named Vorash. Jinto suddenly realized he'd never looked down on his true home planet.
"How long have you been here again? Five years?" Dorin asked.
"Seven," Jinto said, snapping out of his trance. "The invasion of the Hyde star system was in the year Ruecoth 945."
"Wow. And they hustled you out of there right away?"
"Yeah. Like an animal being taken to the zoo, they threw me into a departing Frash, then took me to an orbiting Rebisath before I even knew what was happening."
"You must have had an attendant, right?" Dorin asked as he scrounged up some coins and put them into a passing vending machine. He selected two coffees (Surgu). He offered one to Jinto. "Here, my treat."
"Thanks."
"No problem. It's not everyday you get to treat the son of a Voda."
Jinto smiled. "After I left Martine, I never had an attendant."
"But you were only ..." Dorin trailed off, thwarted by numbers again. "What, eleven?"
"Ten."
"What kind of nincompoop sends a ten-year-old kid to another star system all by himself?"
"Well, I wasn't entirely alone. They assigned one of the Rebisath's duty clerks to me, probably at my father's request. She helped me out — brought me meals and stuff."
"That's sweet. Luxurious," Dorin said enviously. "An elegant space journey."
"It wasn't like that. Really," Jinto pleaded, sipping his Surgu. "I couldn't even speak to her. At the time, there wasn't a mechanical interpreter that could speak Martinese. She tried to do something with a machine fluent in ancient English, but-"
"What's English?"
"Martinese is derived from ancient English, which traces all the way back to Earth. But it's very different from Martinese, and I never learned it, so it's gibberish to me."
"Just like Abh!" Like most Delktou people, Dorin knew no Abh.
"Yes. But it didn't matter. I didn't feel like talking to her anyway."
"Was she Abh?"
"It didn't matter. At the time, she was just 'one of the invaders.' I remember she had black hair, so in hindsight, she was definitely born on a land world. Probably a Rue Lef."
"If she were Abh, maybe you would have liked her more," Dorin suggested.
"What makes you say that?"
"Jeez, man, they're all gorgeous!"
Jinto took slight offense. "She was really nice to me at a time when I had no one else. She got me through all the enrollment procedures here. And despite all her help, I never even learned her name. She probably told me, but I couldn't separate it from the gibberish."
"What a story! Sounds like the first chapter to an epic romance. Too bad she's probably old enough to be your grandma now. If she were Abh though, you wouldn't know it."
Abh people didn't age.
Jinto just shook his head. He's so incorrigible.
"What?" Dorin asked, hoping to placate Jinto. "You know I've got ladies on the brain twenty-seven hours a day."
Undeniably true, Jinto thought. "You always blow every relationship out of proportion. I mean, if you sideswiped someone in traffic, you'd call her your girlfriend."
"I'm offended. I am," Dorin announced with feigned umbrage. "I mean, for starters, she'd have to be cute. Really, really cute. Second, I don't want a girlfriend. One night's enough."
"Hah!" Jinto slapped his knee. "How would you know?"
"Personal experience."
"No way! You've never been with a woman!"
Dorin used two fingers to direct Jinto's eyes to his. Very deliberately, he said, "Seriously."
"Yeah, right! I've only ever seen you with a girl once, and I think she was your sister."
"Look, you said never. Compared to never, once is as big as infinity."
"Gross! That's your sister we're talking about! I didn't know you were into that sort of thing."
"Shut up. I'm not talking about my sister. I've hooked up with someone who isn't related to me."
"Just once?"
"So many times, I can't count!" Dorin said indignantly. "You just never met her."
"Oh."
"And what about you?" Dorin asked. "You're so repressed. It's not healthy. You need to get out there and find a woman. Unless," Dorin smiled coyly, "you're not into that sort of thing."
Jinto played along. "You got me. But don't worry. No matter how much it pains me, I won't put the moves on you."
"It's never too late, Jinto. Just say the word, and I'm yours."
"With all these people watching?"
"Who are they to judge our love?"
Jinto laughed. "You should be careful, talking like that-if I weren't straight, I might have gone for it."
Dorin laughed. "Don't worry — I wouldn't let it get out of hand. If you're straight, then I'm fanatically hetero. But only because I wouldn't have any guy except you."
."True. Cheers," Jinto toasted. They polished off the coffee and threw the paper cups into the trash receptacle in the table's center. "Thanks."
"The least I can do for a young noble," Dorin said smugly, glancing to the right. He nudged Jinto. "Check it out."
Jinto turned and looked.
At the next table sat a dark, middle-aged woman, her brown eyes rudely surveying Jinto's Sif garments and brown hair.
What would I do, Jinto thought, if I were a real Abh nobleman? Shout at her for being rude? Ignore her? Or would I shoot her dead with no explanation ?
Dissatisfied with these choices, Jinto simply chose to flash her a smarmy smile.
Busted, the middle-aged woman averted her gaze.
Jinto sighed.
"Look at you! That old broad is totally hot for you. If I could just borrow your face for a while..."
"It's the clothes," Jinto explained. "A lander wearing Imperial clothes is as common as a dog using Grei to eat."
"Well, you're workin' it. For a lander, at least."
"Thanks," Jinto said modestly, followed by a slightly uncomfortable silence.
"Are the Abh really as pretty as they say?" Dorin asked. "I've only ever seen them in holograms."
"Don't know," Jinto said. "I've never seen one up close, either."
"But you went to an Abh school."
At first perplexed, he finally deciphered his friend's misunderstanding. "Yes, I went to an Abh language and culture school, but there were no Abh students, nor even Abh teachers. The school's goal is to educate citizen candidates, and the teachers are all former citizens who aren't genetically Abh. For example, the founder and the headmistress are both divorced women; they're former territorial citizens of Rue Lef Dreuhynu Vorlak. But even though they're Imperial citizens, they're not related to the Frybar or Count Vorash's family in any way. It's simply a private school under the jurisdiction of the territorial government's education department."
"Oh, I thought it was an Imperial establishment."
"Nope. Why would the Abh ever give money to a lander school?"
"That makes sense." Dorin nodded. "Wait — then why'd you come to Delktou instead of going to an Abh school? Knowing Delktou's language won't help you at all."
"The Abh don't have primary schools. So, if you're not a super genius and you don't speak Abh, there's no point trying to go to an Abh high school."
"How do the Abh learn to read and write then?" Durin asked.
"The same way they learn how to speak — from their parents."
The Abh definitely wouldn't allow landers to educate their children in their most formative years. Because their society was intrinsically hierarchical, the Abh emphasized family traditions (Jhedirl). In order to retain those traditions, it was important for parents to conduct primary education.
Thus, the Abh devoted themselves to educating their young children. Nobles who held Ribeun hired representatives (Toserl), and even Lef took time off from their duties to model successors in their own image.
Automated teaching computers (Onwarele) worked with Abh children to fill in any gaps in teachings, and they instituted training camp outings to teach the children valuable social skills.
"Mine was an unusual education," Jinto explained. "Since my father is Count Hyde-I mean, Dreu Haider-I needed to learn the Abh language and culture, but he couldn't teach it to me. He doesn't even understand it himself. That's why they sent me to the most accessible school for Rue Lef candidates."
"And it took seven years?" Dorin laughed. "I always thought you were smart, but maybe you're not the sharpest pencil in the box after all."
"I couldn't even speak Delktou's language for half of the first year I was here!"
"Well, we are a barbaric people on a squalid, rustic Aith," Dorin said facetiously.
"You'd actually believe that, if you ever saw Martine. The very best buildings on Delktou are no match for a Martinese complex," Jinto boasted.
"Even this tower?" Dorin countered, slightly malevolently.
Point, Dorin, Jinto conceded mentally. Due to anti-Abh resistance on Martine, there would be no construction of an orbital tower like those surrounding most planets of the Frybar. The Martinese still had to rely on dangerous and costly Frash to board spaceships. Consequently, there were fewer Martinese volunteers for space travel.
"This tower is absurdly huge," Jinto finally said.
"Yes, everything's bigger in Delktou," Dorin said proudly. "Hey, that lady's checking you out again."
Exasperated, Jinto mussed his brown locks. "It's my hair." Running the gamut from aqua to near-purple, Abh hair was invariably blue.
"Maybe you should dye it. It couldn't be that hard."
"You know, I thought about that. Decided against it."
"Why?"
"For one thing, I don't want to forget who I am. If I dyed my hair, I might start to think I'm a real Abh, in spite of my lander genes."
"You have another reason?"
"Just stubborn, I guess. I may be Rue Sif, but I don't want them to think I'm happy about it."
"Makes sense," Dorin consented. Leaning on the table, he suddenly sported a look of uncharacteristic seriousness. "Hey, if you change your mind and want to escape nobility, I'll help you. This might be your last chance to back out, you know."
"I can resign at any time," Jinto replied.
"But they'll totally cut off your allowance! I could get you a job."
"How? You're just a student."
"I know a manager who understands working students. Actually, he's my uncle. But, you're smart — you could probably get a scholarship or something."
"Thanks, but it's okay," Jinto said. "I want to see the Abh world. Find out what kind of people invaded us."
"Yeah, that makes sense," Dorin said, his tone implying the opposite.
"Besides," Jinto continued, "it's not like I'm leaving a lot of friends behind here. You're the only one who came to see me off."
"Well..." Dorin had nothing else to say.
"If I ever live as a territorial citizen, I'll come here to Delktou, but I'd definitely need to wait until things calm down. As Jinto Linn, I had friends, but after everyone found out I'd been omitting a couple of titles from my name, no one would give me the time of day. So, thanks for understanding."
Humbly, Dorin smiled and said, "It's a good test to see who your real friends are."
"Yeah, no kidding," Jinto agreed. "If I ever need a favor here, I know who to ask."
"Just leave it to me," Dorin quipped. "After school, I'm going to start a business. I'm sure I can make room for a file clerk when you get back."
"Thanks."
Dorin glanced at the room's huge, ceiling-mounted clock. "Which ship are you boarding? Don't you need go?"
"I'm on a Frybar Wikreurl."
"No way!" A pause. "You know I have no idea what that means, right?"
Jinto laughed. "It's a warship. New students get to travel with the Frybar's war fleet. I was nervous about it at first, but, if I'm going to be a Lodair, I may as well see what it's like."
"And this 'Wikreurl' is coming to this spaceport?" Dorin asked.
"Not sure. Somebody is coming to get me at eighteen hundred hours. That's why I wore these clothes; I'll stick out, so they can find me easily."
"So, an Abh soldier is coming here?"
Jinto shrugged. "I don't know if he'll be Abh or not, but a Labule officer is coming to get me soon."
"I better get out of here, then."
"You're not going to wait until they take me away?"
"And let them see me cry like a baby?" Dorin joked, standing up. "Not a chance."
Rising, Jinto teased back, "Tears from the most notorious villain on Delktou."
"Oh, stop it. You're embarrassing me." Dorin offered his hand, and Jinto grasped it. "What's your formal name, again?"
"Linn Syun-Rock Jarluk Dreu Haider Jinto. I think."
"You're not even sure about your own name?"
"It seems like somebody else's."
"Well, Linn something-something Jinto, remember my name — Ku Dorin. Compared to yours, it shouldn't be that hard."
"How could I forget you? Don't worry about the titles — I'll always just be Linn Jinto, okay?"
"Whatever you say, Linn Syun-Rock Jarluk Dreu Haider Jinto," Dorin recited, proud of his astute memory.
Jinto smiled and let go of Dorin's hand.
"Do your best, man," Dorin advised.
"You, too. Start that business. I may need a job someday."
"Aye-aye, sir," Dorin barked before saluting smartly and leaving. As he exited the lounge and disappeared into an ascent-tube, Dorin never looked back.
Taking his seat again, Jinto noticed the middle-aged woman had found something else to stare at.
Following her line of sight, Jinto saw a slender figure enter the room. Clad in a black Sorf and crimson belt (Wev), the figure walked toward Jinto, the mere sight sending a chill down his spine.
The long arm of the Rue Labule had come for him.
2 Pilot Trainee (Bene Lodair)

According to Imperial law (Rue Razem), the Imperial family (Fasanzoerl), nobles, and Lef all fell into the broader category of "Abh." Thus, Jinto (the legitimate progeny of a count) was undeniably Abh by at least one definition.
However, "Abh" had also come to be associated with a particular breed of genetically engineered people. In this respect, Jinto was clearly not Abh. Though they originated from Earth humans, the Abh were inarguably an entirely different species.
Never satisfied, the Abh continued to tinker with the genes of their children to prevent hereditary ailments and guarantee racial unity. They meticulously specified more than twenty-seven thousand nucleotide pairs in each child's DNA before the kid ever saw the light of day.
This scrupulous rigidity carried over into their arts as well. For example, Abh poetry was all fixed-form. The Abh claimed structural limitations made their art more refined. Although there was less room for originality, all Abh art was noticeably spectacular.
Likewise, the strict structural limitations of offspring creation produced few colossal disappointments. Abh children were manufactured to their parents' aesthetic tastes, which were similar to many land worlds' (Nahen) general conception of beauty. Mostly.
Thus, Abh people were conspicuously beautiful, and the officer who came to retrieve Jinto was no exception.
She wore a simple military Alpha that kept her long, blue hair in check. Thin but distinct eyebrows formed perfect arches across her pale forehead. An elegant nose rested above plump but firm lips. And those eyes! Her irises were lapis lazuli blue.
She sported a crimson Wev — the sign of a Lodair.
Jinto struggled to determine her age.
It was incredibly difficult to guess an Abh's age from outward appearance alone. During Zaroth, the stage of development from birth until the age of fifteen, the Abh matured like regular people. After that, from the beginning of their Feroth stage, their appearance matured only ten more years. The entire process took approximately twenty-five years. The Abh never showed any physical indications of aging beyond twenty-five.
Though eternally young, the Abh were not immortal. The imperfect nerve cells from which they manufactured their children eventually led to incurable confusion. When their brains quit working, even the Abh could not escape death.
Eternally proud, the Abh arranged for their respiratory systems to stop before their intellect ceased functioning. However, this only occurred after at least two hundred years.
When all was said and done, an Abh who looked to be in his mid-twenties could be anywhere from forty to two hundred and forty years old.
But there was no mistaking the age of this Lodair. She was either in the very end of her Zaroth period, or the very beginning of her Feroth period. She was probably about the same age as Jinto.
Upon closer inspection, Jinto was convinced of the Lodair's age, but gender was harder to guess. Instinct told him the officer was a she, but he couldn't be sure.
Often, Abh men looked like young, beautiful women. And with Abh youth, it was almost impossible to tell.
Parting the sea of people with her (fa's ?) tangible sense of importance, the Abh trainee approached Jinto, walking briskly, gracefully.
Pretentiously, Jinto directed his attention to the rank insignia on the breast of the officer's black uniform (Serlin). It was an inverted isosceles triangle, but with curved sides. In the center of the triangle there was a roaring, silver Gaftonosh, which was simultaneously the coat of arms of the Imperial family (Ajh) and the national badge (called the Nigla) of the Frybar. All the signs indicated this was a Lodair Gariar — a flight officer. There were no other decorations on the insignia.
So, she's a Bene Lodair? A pilot trainee?
Like Jinto, she wasn't yet official. After graduating, this Abh would still need to complete a six-month apprenticeship on a Wikreurl or base (Lonid).
A typical teenager, Jinto couldn't help noticing the bosom beneath the insignia. It was just large enough for him to confirm that this Lodair was, in fact, a female.
As she walked toward him, Jinto contemplated meeting her in the middle. Nerves got the best of him, and his feet stayed rooted in his spot.
Violating traditional boundaries of personal space, the pilot trainee came very close to Jinto before she stopped. "Linn Syun-Rock Jarluk Dreu Haider Jinto Lonyu?"
Impressed by the fluidity with which she called his formal name, Jinto just nodded.
She brandished her right hand. Instinctively, Jinto took a step back.
The pilot trainee just raised the hand to her tiara in a traditional Abh greeting.
"I've come from the Gosroth to get you. You will come with me." Her voice was feminine in pitch, but her tense inflection was more akin to a man's.
Having delivered her message, she promptly turned on her heels and began to walk away, seemingly indifferent to whether Jinto followed.
What kind of welcome is that? Jinto thought, annoyed.
Then again, he hadn't expected much. Although the dictionary definition of the word "lander" (Aibs) didn't have any discriminatory connotations, his textbooks seemed to imply that landers were susceptible to Abh ridicule. At any rate, he was used to being treated differently.
It didn't seem right to Jinto, and he didn't want to be the kind of person who just accepted baseless scorn.
Maybe this pilot trainee thinks she has better things to do than go pick up the son of a lander-born noble, Jinto reasoned. Nobody on the patrol ship wanted to do it, so they dumped it on the lowest apprentice. That's why she's so grouchy.
Jinto knew from personal experience on Delktou that the beginning of a relationship was crucial. And now he felt uneasy, not even knowing this girl's name.
"Urn... Hey, you!" Jinto called after the pilot trainee.
"What?" She turned around.
"You know my name, but I don't know yours. I'm not sure how it works with the Abh, but it's freaking me out."
The girl's eyes went from big to huge.
Uh-oh. Was that extremely rude? Jinto fretted. He studied Abh culture in school, but maybe they left out some important points of etiquette.
"You can call me Lafiel!" she replied, bursting into a huge grin. She puffed out her chest, as if she'd just won a
fight. The motion caused her hair and the function crystal (Kos Kisegal) on the ends of her connections chains (Kiseg)
to sway.
Whoa. What was that all about? Jinto was suspicious. I just asked her name.
"But, in exchange for that," she continued, "I want to call you just Jinto. Okay?"
The sincerity of Lafiel's expression was like boiling water melting snow — Jinto couldn't stay upset. Her beautiful eyes actually looked scared that he might deny her request.
"O-of course," Jinto nodded vehemently. "I prefer that, anyway."
"Well then, Jinto," said Lafiel, "Let's go."
"Okay." This time he obediently followed her.
"It's my turn to ask you a question, Jinto."
"Shoot."
"Why did you step away when I saluted you?"
"Old habit," Jinto lied. "That's ... uh... how we greet each other on my home world."
"Peculiar." Lafiel bought it. "It looked like you thought I was going to hit you. The greetings on your home world are very strange."
"Anything unfamiliar can seem strange," Jinto reasoned.
"Yes. I was raised Abh, so I know little about other cultures."
"Makes sense."
"But you're Abh too, Jinto. You'd better get used to the Kasarl Gereulak way of doing things."
Jinto secretly groaned. From time to time, the Abh called themselves Kasarl Gereulak — Kin of the Stars — very proudly. Why the Abh chose to associate themselves with giant lumps of burning gas, Jinto couldn't say.
But he could say, "Easier said than done. There are many years of upbringing to unlearn. It'll be hard now."
Jinto sighed, inviting sympathy. His first encounter with the Abh had gone better than he could have expected; he was on a first-name basis with a beautiful girl who was about the same age he was. He'd have to be dead to not be stoked about that.
They reached tube number twenty-six.
Using her Kreuno, Lafiel opened the door, revealing a hundred people's worth of seats occupied by about ten.
"What was the ship's name again?" Jinto wanted to keep the friendly conversation alive.
"Gosroth."
"That's right. What Byr does the Gosroth belong to?"
"It belongs to the Byr Kureyal."
Ah, the training fleet. "Does that mean there are a lot of pilot trainees like you on board?"
"Are you serious?" she asked incredulously.
Jinto blinked. "You know, it was all I could do just to learn the language. Anything you can tell me about military relationships would be most helpful."
"Oh, I see." Lafiel's face darkened briefly. "I will forgive you."
Man. Is that the Abh idea of an apology?
The Feretocork stopped, having taken them up two floors. As they exited, Jinto noticed there were no civilian passengers on this floor, only uniformed workers.
"There are Klejaga that belong to the training fleet," Lafiel explained as she stepped off the platform. "But training ships are for Kenyu. There are no other Bene Lodair aboard like me. The training fleet also has one more responsibility — to break in new ships. The Gosroth was only put into service two months ago. Right now, the Sarerl and crew are practicing maneuvers."
The captain and crew are practicing? That seemed like something to be worried about. "Really?"
"There's nothing to worry about," Lafiel said flatly. "That's a figure of speech. They're all skilled Souk, so the ship's not going to fall apart when you come aboard."
"I wasn't worried," Jinto fibbed.
The wall next to the Dobroria narrowed, making a graceful donut-shaped corridor. Circling around the tube, there was a corridor that led out, where two non-Abh crew members (Sash) stood guard. Many crew members who were non-commissioned officers came from land worlds.
The men saluted. One of them spoke. "Bene, I must inspect your Kreuno, but only because it's a rule."
Lafiel held out her left hand with the Kreuno on it.
The crewmember used a rectangular instrument to read the display on the wristband. "Thank you, Bene. Okay, Lonyu, you're up."
"Of course." Jinto extended his left hand.
The crewmember clearly wondered why a lander like Jinto was a noble, but all the same, he checked Jinto's identity quietly."All clear, Lonyu. Please pass through."
"Thank you," Lafiel said, prodding Jinto through the passage.
Once they were inside the corridor, it began to move along a track. Glancing at the words "Bore Rue Labule" (which meant Imperial Star Force-controlled area) scrawled on the wall, Jinto shivered. On Delktou, the military was something they only read about in history books. Now, he was both literally and metaphorically entering this mysterious organization.
At the end of the automatic track, there was a door. The door opened by itself as Jinto and Lafiel neared. A black spaceship waited just beyond the door.
"Is that the Gosroth?" Jinto asked.
"You're not serious, are you?" Lafiel looked at him sharply.
"I'm ignorant, remember?" Jinto meekly excused his error.
"Yes, but I thought there was a limit to ignorance."
"Now that you mention it, the Rebisath I flew on a long time ago was a little bigger."
"I don't know what class that was, but that ship was certainly much, much bigger than this. This is the Gosroth's embarkation shuttle. We call it a Kalique. It transports Bosnal when the ship can't enter port directly. It's also used to make contact with other ships. Although it can hold fifty passengers, today there's just one."
"What an honor." Does that mean she's going to fly this thing? Jinto panicked; he had a preconceived notion of spaceship pilots (Sedraleia) that didn't include girls his own age. Jinto didn't want to risk wounding his budding relationship with the girl, nor did he want to provoke her.
"Where are you going to sit?" she asked.
"It looks like there's only one seat..."
"The copilot's seat is open, if you want. Or would you prefer the rear residence area?"
"Is there a beautiful flight attendant?" Jinto asked, tweaking an eyebrow.
"No," Lafiel said very seriously, "but there's a beautiful Sedraleia. Now make up your mind."
"Of course I'll sit in the copilot's seat." Jinto swallowed his fear and put his life in her hands.
